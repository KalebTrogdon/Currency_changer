# Currency_changer
# Overview

I want to make sure I understand more about differnt coding langueges and so I have written this code to further my career.

My code is demenstrating how to grab currencys at real time and provied an updated currency exchange.

I wanted to write this because knowing the currency transfer helps with knowing how to plan trips and know if its better to keep yout money in your home currency or not.

Wasn't able to get to the video.

# Development Environment

Writing this in Visual studio helped with making it easier to compile the information.

I am using Javascript, Html, and Css. I have also pulled from exchangerate-api.com but since it is free its hard to get perfectly updated amounts.

# Future Work

Things to make the code better.

- I need to add more currencys.
